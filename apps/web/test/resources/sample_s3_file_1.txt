If you are a big private-markets institutional investor and OpenAI or
SpaceX calls you up and asks you to invest, you might take those valuations
as a starting point.

the Destiny Tech100 fund, a publicly traded closed-end fund that owns
shares of hot private tech companies, including SpaceX. DXYZ trades at
something on the order of a 1,000% premium to its net asset value: It owns
about $56 million of private tech stocks, but its own shares trade at a
market capitalization of about $720 million. One way to think about this is
that retail investors are willing to pay $1,100 to invest $100 in hot
startups like SpaceX. If I came to you and said =E2=80=9Cif you give me $80=

will give you $100 worth of SpaceX shares and keep $700 for myself,=E2=80=

:

In the fall, a Miami-based firm called Sand Hill Road Technologies Fund
offered its customers a hot opportunity: a chance to invest in SpaceX,
which was arranging a deal for employees to sell some of their shares.
But Sand Hill=E2=80=99s prospective investors, wealthy individuals whom the=
 fund
reached through online ads on Google and Meta Platforms apps as well as
email and text, wouldn=E2=80=99t get the shares directly. And it would cost=
 them.

Sand Hill told prospective investors they could get access to shares of
SpaceX for $258 a share, roughly double the $135 that institutional
investors at the time were expected to pay. To do this, they would invest
in a fund=E2=80=94or special purpose vehicle=E2=80=94that was investing in =
another SPV
buying the shares, according to Sand Hill founder and executive
officer Robert Hodgins. If SpaceX ever went public or sold, the investors
would also pay 20% of the profit, a fee called carried interest, on the
investment, to Sand Hill, said Hodgins.

Such high costs for getting a piece of SpaceX reflect the growing demand
from individual investors seeking stakes in private tech startups. Well-off
retail investors are turning to intermediaries who promise access through
SPVs. For shares of some startups, like OpenAI, demand is so high that
investors buy stakes in SPVs that in turn have stakes in other SPVs. But
these complex structures, called double- or second-layer SPVs, create
opportunities for misrepresentation and even fraud.

They also charge for access. Investors in these second-rung SPVs often pay
more in fees than those investing in the first layer or directly in the
startup, as venture firms do. Half of the 20% carry fee charged to
investors in the second-layer Sand Hill SPV goes to managers in the first
fund, according to Hodgins.

The market seems to be sending a signal. The signal is: =E2=80=9CA lot of r=
etail
investors want to own shares in SpaceX and will pay much more for those
shares than SpaceX=E2=80=99s current private-market valuation.=E2=80=9D In =
the olden days,
a giant established private company might respond to that market
signal by *going
public and selling stock to retail investors itself*. But if SpaceX doesn=
=E2=80=99t
want to do that, someone else will step in to meet the demand.

By the way, there=E2=80=99s another trade here. Schematically, if there is =
a ton of
demand for a company=E2=80=99s shares, then two sorts of people can step in=
 to
provide more shares. One is the company: SpaceX or OpenAI could go public,
sell new stock to retail investors, and get a price that clears the market.
SpaceX=E2=80=99s valuation, as a public company, might plausibly be higher =
than
its current private valuation of $350 billion, but lower than the $670
billion implied by that Sand Hill fund price. (Or the, like, $3.5 trillion
implied by DXYZ. [2] <#m_-2218361581616241372_footnote-2>)

The other is *short sellers: *If a lot of people want to buy a stock, and
its price seems too high, short sellers step in to sell extra shares of
stock. That is traditionally harder to do in private markets; you can=E2=80=
=99t
borrow private shares and short them like you would in public markets.
But you could get pretty close, right? Here is the trade:

   1. You set up an SPV that offers people access to SpaceX shares.
   2. You charge them, say, 300% of the current price of SpaceX: They have
   to buy at a $1.05 trillion valuation, because demand is high and supply =
is
   scarce.
   3. *You don=E2=80=99t buy the SpaceX shares*.
   4. The SPV just holds the investors=E2=80=99 cash, but *owes *the invest=
ors
   SpaceX shares.
   5. Eventually SpaceX goes public at some valuation, and you go out and
   buy the shares in the open market and deliver them to your investors. [3=
]
   <#m_-2218361581616241372_footnote-3>
   6. If SpaceX goes public at a valuation of less than $1.05 trillion, you
   buy back the shares for less than the money in the SPV, and you keep the
   rest. This is your profit from shorting SpaceX. Not at its current $350
   billion private valuation, but at its much higher SPV valuation: You=E2=
=80=99re not
   just shorting SpaceX; you=E2=80=99re shorting =E2=80=9Cintense demand fo=
r SpaceX from
   retail investors.=E2=80=9D
   7. If SpaceX goes public at a valuation of more than $1.05 trillion, you
   buy back the shares for more than the money in the SPV, and you are out =
of
   pocket for the rest. You bet wrong, and this is your loss from shorting
   SpaceX.
   8. If SpaceX goes public at a valuation of *much *more than $1.05
   trillion, you don=E2=80=99t have enough money to buy the shares to deliv=
er to your
   investors, and you probably go to prison.

about an insider trading hypothetical involving being hired as the chief
executive officer of a public company. In this hypothetical, you do not yet
work at the company, but you have a job interview to be the CEO, and you
think it went well. You are a confident person, so you walk out of the

So you go buy a bunch of stock. A week later, the company does indeed
announce that it is hiring you as CEO, and the stock does indeed go up. Are
you guilty of insider trading? Ehh, maybe. But to me it mostly seems like
charming optimism and alignment of interests, the sort of thing the company
should be happy about. (The hypothetical was based on a real situation at
the Dutch soccer club AFC Ajax NV, which suspended its CEO

The Securities and Exchange Commission [Wednesday] announced insider
trading charges against Ken Peterman, the former CEO, president, and Chair
of the Board of Comtech Telecommunications Corp., in connection with his
sale of Comtech shares on the basis of material non-public information
about Comtech=E2=80=99s forthcoming negative quarterly earnings results.

According to the SEC complaint, Peterman allegedly received a confidential
presentation detailing Comtech=E2=80=99s forthcoming negative quarterly ear=
nings
results on March 4, 2024. He was allegedly informed that he was being
terminated for cause eight days later, on March 12, 2024. The SEC=E2=80=99s
complaint alleges that a few hours after he was terminated, and while
subject to two different trading blackouts, Peterman placed an order to
sell Comtech stock. On March 18, 2024, Comtech reported its negative
quarterly earnings, which caused its stock price to drop more than 25
percent. The complaint alleges that Peterman avoided losses of about
$12,445 by trading in advance of Comtech=E2=80=99s negative earnings announ=
cement.
Peterman allegedly directed his financial advisor to sell additional
Comtech stock he held in a joint account, but the financial advisor was
unable to complete the sale because of a trading blackout. Had the sale
been completed, Peterman allegedly would have avoided additional losses of
about $110,000.

Weirdly, while the company=E2=80=99s quarterly results were terrible and ca=
used the
stock to drop by 25%, that=E2=80=99s not why he was fired. (And in fact his=
 firing
was announced the morning of March 13, five days before the bad earnings;
the stock dropped 27% that day.) Here=E2=80=99s why he was fired

:

On March 11, 2024, Peterman was interviewed by Comtech=E2=80=99s outside co=
unsel in
connection with an internal investigation.

During the interview, Peterman acknowledged that he had engaged in a sexual
relationship with a subordinate employee over the course of several months
in 2023 and that he had failed to disclose the relationship to Comtech or
its Board, including by omitting any mention of this undisclosed sexual
relationship in his responses to the Directors and Officers Questionnaire
that he signed on October 12, 2023. During the interview, Peterman also
acknowledged that in December 2023, he directed the subordinate employee to
use his credentials to log in and complete the online annual sexual
harassment training required for all Comtech employees.

I feel like if you are having an undisclosed sexual relationship with an
employee you should at least take the online sexual harassment training
yourself? You might learn something useful.
Everything is securities fraud

In 2023, Target Corp. did a Pride Month marketing event that led to a
conservative backlash and boycott. Target=E2=80=99s stock went down. As I o=
ften say
around here, =E2=80=9Ca company did a thing and its stock went down=E2=80=
=9D is the minimal
form of securities fraud, and so people =E2=80=94 specifically =E2=80=9CAme=
rica First Legal
Foundation, led by former senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller=E2=80=9D =E2=
=80=94 sued
Target for securities fraud.

Now it cannot be literally true that *anything *that a company does is
securities fraud if its stock goes down. Securities fraud normally requires
*lying *to investors, or *misleading *them, or at least *not mentioning*
something important. There are two normal forms of =E2=80=9Ceverything is
securities fraud.=E2=80=9D One is:

   1. A company does a bad thing.
   2. It doesn=E2=80=99t tell anyone about it.
   3. Eventually it does, and its stock goes down.
   4. Investors sue, saying =E2=80=9CI bought the stock after you did the b=
ad thing
   but before you told us about it, so I was misled, and when you told us
   about it, the stock went down.

So if the company=E2=80=99s chief executive officer commits sexual harassme=
nt for
years, and the company never mentions it, and then one day the company
fires the CEO and discloses that he was doing harassment, arguably that is
fraud.

The other is:

   1. A company does a bad thing.
   2. It immediately discloses the bad thing, and the stock goes down.
   3. Investors sue, saying =E2=80=9Cyour disclosures *before *the bad thin=
g made
   me think that you wouldn=E2=80=99t do the bad thing, but those disclosur=
es were
   misleading, because you did the bad thing.=E2=80=9D

So if the company=E2=80=99s CEO commits sexual harassment, and the company
discloses it five minutes later and fires him, you can=E2=80=99t really sue=
 the
company for lying about his sexual harassment. But if the company had an
ethics policy saying =E2=80=9Cwe expect our executives to behave appropriat=
ely,=E2=80=9D
and publicized that policy, maybe you can sue the company

because the ethics policy is arguably misleading. =E2=80=9CYou told me exec=
utives
would act ethically, and they didn=E2=80=99t.=E2=80=9D [4]
<#m_-2218361581616241372_footnote-4>

In these examples, I am trying to stretch the theory as far as it will go.
=E2=80=9CYou didn=E2=80=99t mention the CEO=E2=80=99s sexual harassment=E2=
=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cyou had an ethics
policy but the CEO did harassment anyway=E2=80=9D are *weak *cases of secur=
ities
fraud. On the theory that everything is securities fraud, I expect people
to *bring *lawsuits like this but not necessarily to *win *them. Sometimes
a judge will dismiss them, saying that the company didn=E2=80=99t actually =
say
anything materially misleading.

The Target case struck me as even weaker. Target did, obviously, tell
everyone about its Pride Month marketing event. (It was a marketing event!)

a risk factor that pretty clearly warned investors about this sort of risk:

Our reputation is based in large part on perceptions, both about us and
others with whom we do business, and broad access to social media makes it
easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions
of Target. It may be difficult to control negative publicity, regardless of
whether it is accurate. Target=E2=80=99s responses to crises and our positi=
on or
perceived lack of position on environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
matters, such as sustainability, responsible sourcing, and diversity,
equity, and inclusion (DE&I), and any perceived lack of transparency about
those matters, could harm our reputation. While reputations may take
decades to build, negative incidents involving us or others with whom we do
business can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer
boycotts, workforce unrest or walkouts, government investigations, or
litigation.

Defendants=E2=80=99 general warning in their risk disclosure could be mater=

made a general disclosure that reputational incidents could affect its
business. Target=E2=80=99s 2021 disclosure, for the most part, focuses on i=

Target

disclosure neither mentions Target=E2=80=99s upcoming 2023 Pride Month Camp=

This is pretty close to finding that everything really is securities fraud.

The Court also disagreed with Target=E2=80=99s argument that shareholders
understood the risk that it could be boycotted for pride campaigns because
it had been boycotted for pride campaigns before. It found that the prior
campaigns didn=E2=80=99t put shareholders on notice of risks that might ari=
se from
=E2=80=9Cplacing potentially controversial merchandise at the center of its
stores=E2=80=94could be construed as a change to their ESG/DEI campaigns in=
 prior
years.=E2=80=9D

I take it from this that if Target were to relocate adult-oriented
merchandise from one location to another in the store, it might also be
securities fraud? This issue isn=E2=80=99t limited to Target. Could Walmart=
 face
securities fraud liability under this theory if it relocates products from
one area to another? Do we want retailers to really add risk factor
disclosures that they could be boycotted if they do something differently
than they did it in the past? How does that substantially alter the total
mix of information available?

But it=E2=80=99s worse than that: Even disclosing =E2=80=9Cwe might be boyc=
otted if we do
something differently=E2=80=9D is not enough; the disclosure needs to be
=E2=80=9Cspecifically tailored to the risks=E2=80=9D from the particular th=
ing you are
doing. Every time you launch an advertising campaign or move merchandise
around, you need to put out a risk factor saying =E2=80=9Cwe are launching =
this new
advertising campaign, people might not like it, and if they don=E2=80=99t s=
ales
might go down.=E2=80=9D Everything you do might not work out! But if you do=
n=E2=80=99t warn
investors specifically about each risk, you can get sued.
Pivot to AI

Bitcoin mining is basically an abstract process for turning electricity and
computer chips into money. Artificial intelligence is also an abstract
process for turning electricity and computer chips into money. Bitcoin
mining was, for practical purposes, commercialized first, and so there are
a lot of Bitcoin miners out there. But AI is plausibly bigger and more
lucrative now, so there are some Bitcoin miners who are surprised and
relieved to find that, actually, they can get into the AI business. Others =
need
a push though

Activist investor Starboard Value has built a significant position in Riot
Platforms and is pushing for changes at the bitcoin-mining operator,
according to people familiar with the matter. ...

As a crypto miner, Riot uses high-powered computers to process bitcoin
transactions by solving complex mathematical problems, receiving bitcoin as
payment.

Starboard has been in discussions with Riot=E2=80=99s management team to pu=
sh the
company to convert some of its bitcoin-mining facilities into capacity for
so-called hyperscalers, or large data-center users, the people said.

Hyperscalers are companies that operate large-scale data centers designed
to handle massive amounts of computing power and storage capacity. Data
centers operated by companies such as Amazon Web Services and Alphabet=E2=
=80=99s
Google Cloud have grown increasingly important as the
artificial-intelligence boom gobbles up even more computing power and
resources.

It really is an amazing coincidence that not only were crypto and AI
roughly consecutive booms led by, often, the same sorts of entrepreneurs
and backed by the same sorts of venture capitalists, but also that they run
on similar infrastructure. You could imagine the crypto boom collapsing and
leaving all of its mining equipment useless =E2=80=94 but in fact the minin=
g
equipment could turn around and fuel the AI boom.

The Securities and Exchange Commission [Wednesday] charged Chibuzo
Augustine Onyeachonam, Stanley Chidubem Asiegbu, and Chukwuebuka Martin
Nweke-Eze with fraud for impersonating legitimate securities brokers and
investment advisers in an elaborate online scheme through which the
defendants stole more than $2.9 million from at least 28 investors.

As alleged in the SEC=E2=80=99s complaint, from at least 2019 to the presen=
t, the
three defendants, who reside in Nigeria, created websites impersonating
nearly two dozen actual securities brokers and investment adviser
representatives (collectively, representatives) at well-known U.S.
securities firms as part of a fraudulent scheme to entice potential
investors in the United States to invest funds with the defendants. The
defendants allegedly lured investors to the websites by placing fictitious
comments from purported clients on social media and in investment group
chats praising the representatives=E2=80=99 trading success. The SEC=E2=80=
=99s complaint
alleges that the defendants promised monthly returns of up to 25 percent
and directed investors to fake online investment platforms they created to
make investors think their portfolios were increasing in value. In
addition, according to the SEC=E2=80=99s complaint, the defendants purchase=
d voice
changing software to talk to investors, as most of the impersonated
professionals were women.

According to Onyeachonam=E2=80=99s public Goodreads profile, fifteen days a=
fter
Onyeachonam registered the Lumentrades.com domain in 2018, Onyeachonam
read *The

Thanks!*

[1] Unless I was lying about having the SpaceX shares, which does happen.
Also to be clear this is *not* exactly the deal that DXYZ is offering: If
you invest $1,100 in DXYZ, you get $1,100 of DXYZ shares, which might even
go up. But those shares represent $100 of underlying private company
shares, plus a lot of premium.

[2] I=E2=80=99m being very casual saying that DXYZ=E2=80=99s 1,000%-ish pre=
mium to net
asset value implies any sort of price for SpaceX. It=E2=80=99s not like tha=
t 1,000%
premium means that the market values *each* of DXYZ=E2=80=99s positions at =
10 times
their balance-sheet value. If anything, it probably values the SpaceX stake
disproportionately more than the other stuff.

[3] Or it gets acquired, merges, etc., in which case your obligation is
probably converted into cash or public stock and you either pay out cash or
buy the stock. Or it goes bankrupt, in which case you keep all the money.

[4] Or if you say =E2=80=9Cintegrity and honesty are at the heart of our bu=
siness=E2=80=9D
and then you rip off customers, maybe that is securities fraud

lockquote> <p style=3D"margin:16px 0">In the fall, a Miami-based firm calle=
d Sand Hill Road Technologies Fund offered its customers a hot opportunity:=
 a chance to invest in SpaceX, which was arranging a deal for employees to =
sell some of their shares. But=C2=A0Sand Hill=E2=80=99s prospective investo=
rs, wealthy individuals whom the fund reached through online ads on Google =
and Meta Platforms apps as well as email and text, wouldn=E2=80=99t get the=
 shares directly. And it would cost them.</p> <p style=3D"margin:16px 0">Sa=
nd Hill told prospective investors they could get access to shares of Space=
X for $258 a share, roughly double the $135 that institutional investors at=
 the time were expected to pay. To do this, they would invest in a fund=E2=
=80=94or special purpose vehicle=E2=80=94that was investing in another SPV =
buying the shares, according to Sand Hill founder and executive officer=C2=
=A0Robert Hodgins. If SpaceX ever went public or sold, the investors would =
also pay 20% of the profit, a fee called carried interest, on the investmen=
t, to Sand Hill, said Hodgins.</p> <p style=3D"margin:16px 0">Such high cos=
ts for getting a piece of SpaceX reflect the growing demand from individual=
 investors seeking stakes in private tech startups. Well-off retail investo=
rs are turning to intermediaries who promise access through SPVs. For share=
s of some startups, like OpenAI, demand is so high that investors buy stake=
s in SPVs that in turn have stakes in other SPVs. But these complex structu=
res, called double- or second-layer SPVs, create opportunities for misrepre=
sentation and even fraud.</p> <p style=3D"margin:16px 0">They also charge f=
or access. Investors in these second-rung SPVs often pay more in fees than =
those investing in the first layer or directly in the startup, as venture f=
irms do. Half of the 20% carry fee charged to investors in the second-layer=
 Sand Hill=C2=A0SPV goes to managers in the first fund, according to Hodgin=
s.</p> </blockquote> <p style=3D"margin:16px 0">The market seems to be send=

 shares in SpaceX and will pay much more for those shares than SpaceX=E2=80=

demand.</p> <p style=3D"margin:16px 0">By the way, there=E2=80=99s another =
trade here. Schematically, if there is a ton of demand for a company=E2=80=

ne is the company: SpaceX or OpenAI could go public, sell new stock to reta=

current private valuation of $350 billion, but lower than the $670 billion =
implied by that Sand Hill fund price. (Or the, like, $3.5 trillion implied =
